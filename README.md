# Pachyderm IDE

A JupyterHub-based IDE for Pachyderm. Built to deploy on Kubernetes, alongside Pachyderm.

**Note** This is a Pachyderm Enterprise feature. Contact sales@pachyderm.com for more information.

## Deploying

1) [Deploy pachyderm](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/).
2) Run `pachctl deploy ide`.
3) If there's a firewall between you and the kubernetes cluster, make sure to punch a hole so you can connect to port 80 on it. [See cloud-specific instructions here.](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create-k8s-cluster.html)

If you need to customize your IDE deployment more than what `pachctl deploy ide` offers, see our [advanced setup guide.](doc/advanced_setup.md)

## Using

Once deployed, navigate to your instance:

- By default, it should be reachable on port 80 of your cluster's hostname.
- On minikube, navigate to one of the URLs printed out when you run `minikube service proxy-public --url`.

You should see a login page. Once you're logged in, you should be able to connect to the Pachyderm cluster from within a Jupyter notebook; e.g., if Pachyderm auth is enabled, try this:

```python
import python_pachyderm
client = python_pachyderm.Client.new_in_cluster()
print(client.who_am_i())
```

Notice that, without configuration:

1) `python_pachyderm` is already installed.
2) The username for `who_am_i()` is the same as your Jupyter login username.

For a more advanced example, see our [opencv walkthrough](doc/opencv.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot reach the IDE

If `pachyderm deploy ide` finished successfully but you're having trouble getting to the IDE, ensure you've followed the cloud-specific instructions in [JupyterHub's setup guides](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create-k8s-cluster.html).

### Getting "Service Unavailable" errors when connecting

It may take a couple of minutes for the IDE to get fully up and running. Keep an eye on `kubectl` logs for errors in the hub pod.

### Cannot connect to Pachyderm in Jupyter notebooks

In Jupyter notebooks, make sure you're using `python_pachyderm.Client.new_in_cluster()` to create a client -- this will ensure the client is automatically configured to work with the Pachyderm cluster, which should be running in the same Kubernetes cluster as the IDE.

### Cannot authenticate to Pachyderm in Jupyter notebooks

When you create a `python_pachyderm.Client` in a Jupyter notebook, it should automatically be setup to use an auth token tied to the logged-in JupyterHub user. If you're able to connect but not authenticate:

- If you're passing in an `auth_token` to the `Client`, make sure it's valid.
- If you aren't passing in an `auth_token`, try logging out, deleting the JupyterHub user pod (it should look something like `pod/jupyter-github-3aysimonson`), and logging back in. It's possible that the auth state has been corrupted or lost.
